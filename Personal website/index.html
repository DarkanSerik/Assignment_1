    <p><em>My name is Serik Darkan Serikuly, I was born on January 11, in 2004 in the city of <strong>Atyrau</strong>. I am a 1-st year student at <a href="https://astanait.edu.kz/"><strong>Astana IT University</strong></a>. There are 3 people in our
        family. Mom's name is Ainur. Dad's name is Serik. I have been living in <strong>Nur-Sultan</strong> since 2013. And in 2013 we moved to Nur-Sultan. We didn't know what to do. But we believed that we would succeed. And right now, I can proudly
        say that we have succeeded, and will still succeed. And I want to tell you about myself in detail. First, about my family. I am the only son at home.</em></p>

    <p class="bio">
      As you can see, there are three of us in the family. And I think this is more of a difference than a disadvantage. First of all, it is good for me that I am an only child in the family, others think so. But I certainly think the opposite. I
      would
      be glad if there was another child in my family. I would be even more glad if it was my sister. Well, or was there an older brother. It's great when you have someone to rely on. Another difference between our family and others is age. We have
      very different ages. Dad is 55, mom is 47, and I am 17. Why do you think there is such a difference in age: Because dad was in no hurry to get married. Mom was in no hurry either. But the most interesting thing is that they met for about 3
      months
      and got married right away. Then Dad was a fisherman and earned good money. And my mother studied. In her youth, she studied and worked. But of course, I studied on the bigger side. And they were introduced, their mutual friend. It all started
      with this. They got married in 2002 and got engaged near the Caspian Sea. I was born in 2004. Dad was very happy when I was born. He celebrated 40 days as they say. But there was one thing. I was not born completely healthy. But luckily, I
      recovered with the help of doctors and my parents. And so the years passed. We lived in the city of Atyrau. And in the end. I may have a small family, but with a big soul. I love my family.

      It was a biology Olympiad. I will not say that it was easy. But I think I did it well. I got 2 achievements in the 10th grade.
      And then I decided not to give up and go all the way. And I took part in the international Olympiad.
      And then it did not work to take a seat. Well, it seems not so, and I'm really smart. <p class="display_i">Yes, my achievements are few, but they are.</p></em>

  <div class="mydreams">
    <h1>For more details:</h1>
    <p>I've had these dreams since childhood. I started dreaming at the age of 7. Well, of course, there were no such global dreams. But still there were. At first I dreamed about my bike.
      I loved to ride my bike. Then they bought me a bike at 8. I was very happy. After that, I began to believe that dreams come true. After that, I started dreaming more and more.
      And finally, I found my widest dream. And now you see 3 of my global dreams. </p>
      <h2>Huge house:</h2>
      <p class="blue">I dream of a huge house because my family lived only in apartments, that is, they rented, just recently bought an apartment. But I would still like to build the house myself.
        So that at first the parents were comfortable living. From the second, so that guests can come, and that there is always enough space for them. </p>
      <h2>Bugatti chiron:</h2>
      <p class="green">I love cars since childhood, but I love fast cars even more. At first I dreamed of Toyota, Lexus. But right now I realized that this is too flickering a dream.
        And changed my dream to a bugatti. It seems not achievable, but there are people who buy. So anything is possible. </p>
      <h2>Personal plane:</h2>
      <p class="red">The plane is a separate verse. I do not know why, I have such a feeling that I will have my own private plane.
        And this is not the first. I want a private jet so I don't have to be tied to airline companies. So that at any time, he wanted, sat down, flew. </p>
